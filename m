Hello everyone,

Firstly, I am Apologize for the trouble. I have something I want to
tell you.

Information
===========
As you may know, the server was down yesterday. I didn't realize that
until Ammar mentioned me in the telegram. The server down because the
billing account was ran out of credit. The server should be fine now
(if this email is sent).

Server shutdown
===============
Life getting hard, the company I worked for didn't go well, and I ended
up getting layoffs a few weeks ago. I am not sure if I can keep this
server up. I have to prioritize my expenses. So, I am planning to
shutdown the server next month. However, if you want to keep the server
up. You can help me pay the server by make a donation to this community.

     - Referral program

       credit if you register using referral code (v63w0g) or link[2]

       This is what they says:

         > makes at least one minimum payment, you will receive Rp 50.000
         > worth of free credits. Every new user receives a bonus worth
         > of Rp 50.000 credits when signing up through the referral
